# Garbage Collection for Datahike

## Overview

Datacamp provides an optimized garbage collection implementation for Datahike that addresses critical performance issues in production environments with large databases.

### Key Features

- **Resumable Marking**: The mark phase saves checkpoints periodically, allowing resumption from the last checkpoint if interrupted
- **Batch Deletion**: The sweep phase deletes keys in batches rather than individually, providing 20-60x performance improvement
- **Safe by Default**: The public API defaults to dry-run mode to prevent accidental data deletion
- **Auto-Resume**: Automatically detects and resumes interrupted GC operations
- **Backend Optimizations**: Automatically applies optimal settings based on the storage backend

### Performance Improvements

| Phase | Standard Datahike | Optimized GC | Improvement |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Mark Phase** | 6 hours (non-resumable) | 6 hours (resumable with checkpoints) | Fault-tolerant |
| **Sweep Phase** | 2+ days | 2-4 hours | 20-60x faster |
| **Total Time** | ~2.5 days | 8-10 hours | 6-7x faster |
| **Reliability** | Must restart if interrupted | Can resume from checkpoint | âœ… |

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

The simplest way to use the optimized GC is through the safe, high-level API:

```clojure
(require '[datacamp.core :as datacamp])

;; Step 1: Preview what would be deleted (dry-run is default)
(let [result (datacamp/gc! conn)]
  (println "Would keep:" (:reachable-count result) "items")
  (println "Would delete:" (:would-delete-count result) "items"))

;; Step 2: Actually run GC with explicit opt-in
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false :retention-days 30)

;; Step 3: Check status at any time
(datacamp/gc-status conn)
;; => {:status :in-progress, :gc-id "gc-2024...", :visited-count 5000, ...}
```

### Production Usage Pattern

For production databases, follow this recommended pattern:

```clojure
(defn production-gc [conn]
  ;; Always start with a dry run
  (let [dry-result (datacamp/gc! conn :retention-days 30)]
    (println "Preview - would delete:" (:would-delete-count dry-result) "items")

    ;; Verify the numbers make sense before proceeding
    (when (and (< (:would-delete-count dry-result)
                  (* 0.9 (:reachable-count dry-result))) ; Safety check
               (user-confirms?))
      ;; Run actual GC - will auto-resume if interrupted
      (datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false :retention-days 30))))
```

## Architecture

### Data Storage

All datacamp-specific data is stored under the `:datacamp` namespace key in Konserve to prevent conflicts:

```clojure
[:datacamp :gc-checkpoint]  ; GC checkpoint location
```

### Checkpoint Mechanism

The checkpoint system ensures GC can resume after interruption:

1. **Checkpoint Creation**: Every 100 commits or 30 seconds during marking
2. **Checkpoint Content**:
   - Visited commits
   - Reachable items
   - Branch progress
   - Statistics
3. **Resume Logic**: On restart, checks for existing checkpoint and continues
4. **Cleanup**: Checkpoint is automatically deleted after successful completion

### Batch Operations

Batch operations are implemented with a `batch-` prefix to avoid conflicts with future Konserve implementations:

```clojure
(batch-dissoc! store keys)     ; Our implementation
;; Future: (multi-dissoc store keys)  ; Konserve's potential future API
```

## API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `datacamp.core/gc!`

Run optimized garbage collection on a database.

**Parameters:**
- `conn` - Datahike connection
- `:dry-run` - Preview mode without deletion (default: `true`)
- `:retention-days` - Keep commits from last N days (default: `7`)
- `:batch-size` - Keys per batch (default: auto-detected)
- `:parallel-batches` - Concurrent batch operations (default: auto-detected)
- `:checkpoint-interval` - Commits between checkpoints (default: `100`)
- `:force-new` - Force new GC even if one is in progress (default: `false`)

**Returns:**
```clojure
{:reachable-count 150000    ; Items kept
 :deleted-count 850000       ; Items deleted (or :would-delete-count in dry-run)
 :duration-ms 28800000       ; Total duration
 :resumed? true}             ; Whether resumed from checkpoint
```

#### `datacamp.core/gc-status`

Check the status of an ongoing or interrupted GC operation.

**Parameters:**
- `conn` - Datahike connection

**Returns:**
```clojure
{:status :in-progress        ; or :no-gc-in-progress
 :gc-id "gc-2024-..."       ; Unique GC identifier
 :started-at #inst "..."     ; Start time
 :visited-count 5000         ; Commits processed
 :reachable-count 150000     ; Items found reachable
 :completed-branches 2       ; Branches completed
 :pending-branches 1}        ; Branches remaining
```

### Backend-Specific Optimizations

The system automatically detects and applies optimal settings:

| Backend | Batch Size | Parallel Batches | Strategy |
|---------|------------|------------------|----------|
| **S3** | 1,000 | 3 | AWS batch delete API (1000 objects/call) |
| **PostgreSQL** | 5,000 | 1 | `DELETE WHERE key = ANY(array)` |
| **File System** | 100 | 10 | Thread pool parallel deletion |
| **Memory** | 1,000 | 1 | Atomic batch operations |

## Configuration

### Retention Policies

Configure how much history to retain:

```clojure
;; Keep last 7 days (default)
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false :retention-days 7)

;; Keep last 30 days
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false :retention-days 30)

;; Keep last year
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false :retention-days 365)

;; Keep everything (only delete orphaned data)
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false
              :retention-days Integer/MAX_VALUE)
```

### Advanced Configuration

For specific requirements, use the lower-level API:

```clojure
(require '[datacamp.gc :as gc]
         '[clojure.core.async :refer [<?!!]])

(<?!! (gc/gc-storage-optimized! @conn
                                :remove-before (Date. ...)
                                :batch-size 5000
                                :parallel-batches 4
                                :checkpoint-interval 50
                                :dry-run false))
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

Tests are integrated with the Datacamp test suite and managed through Babashka:

```bash
# Run all GC tests
bb test:gc

# Run specific test suites
bb test:gc:core    # Core GC functionality tests
bb test:gc:api     # Public API tests
bb test:gc:batch   # Batch operations tests

# Run all tests including GC
bb test:all

# Run with coverage
bb coverage
```

The GC tests are designed to work with in-memory databases for speed and reliability. They cover:
- Checkpoint save/load/resume operations
- Dry-run and actual GC execution
- Auto-resume functionality
- Backend-specific optimizations
- Error handling and edge cases

### Test Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Core GC**: 90%+ coverage of marking, sweep, and checkpoint logic
- **Public API**: 95%+ coverage of user-facing functions
- **Batch Operations**: 85%+ coverage of backend-specific optimizations
- **Edge Cases**: 80%+ coverage of error conditions and recovery

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites

1. **Backup**: Always backup your database before running GC
2. **Monitoring**: Set up monitoring for GC operations
3. **Maintenance Window**: Schedule during low-traffic periods

### Deployment Strategy

#### Phase 1: Staging Validation
```clojure
;; Test with smaller dataset
(let [result (datacamp/gc! staging-conn :retention-days 30)]
  (validate-results result))
```

#### Phase 2: Production Dry Run
```clojure
;; Preview on production without deletion
(let [result (datacamp/gc! prod-conn :retention-days 30)]
  (analyze-impact result))
```

#### Phase 3: Production Execution
```clojure
;; Run with monitoring
(let [start (System/currentTimeMillis)]
  (loop []
    (let [status (datacamp/gc-status prod-conn)]
      (when (= :in-progress (:status status))
        (log-progress status)
        (Thread/sleep 60000)
        (recur))))
  (log-completion (- (System/currentTimeMillis) start)))
```

### Monitoring and Alerts

Set up monitoring for:

1. **Progress Tracking**
   ```clojure
   (defn monitor-gc [conn]
     (let [status (datacamp/gc-status conn)]
       (when (= :in-progress (:status status))
         (metrics/gauge "gc.visited" (:visited-count status))
         (metrics/gauge "gc.reachable" (:reachable-count status))
         (metrics/gauge "gc.branches.completed" (:completed-branches status)))))
   ```

2. **Duration Alerts**
   ```clojure
   (defn check-gc-duration [conn started-at max-hours]
     (let [elapsed-hours (/ (- (System/currentTimeMillis) started-at)
                            (* 1000 60 60))]
       (when (> elapsed-hours max-hours)
         (alert/send :severity :warning
                    :message (str "GC running for " elapsed-hours " hours")))))
   ```

3. **Checkpoint Health**
   ```clojure
   (defn verify-checkpoint-freshness [conn]
     (let [status (datacamp/gc-status conn)]
       (when (= :in-progress (:status status))
         (let [age-minutes (/ (- (System/currentTimeMillis)
                                (.getTime (:last-checkpoint status)))
                             60000)]
           (when (> age-minutes 10)
             (alert/send :severity :error
                        :message "GC checkpoint stale"))))))
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### GC Takes Longer Than Expected

**Symptoms**: GC runs for more than expected duration

**Solutions**:
1. Increase batch size for your backend
2. Increase parallel batches (if backend supports it)
3. Check for database lock contention

```clojure
;; Optimize for throughput
(datacamp/gc! conn
             :dry-run false
             :batch-size 10000        ; Larger batches
             :parallel-batches 5)     ; More parallelism
```

#### Out of Memory During Mark Phase

**Symptoms**: OOM errors during marking

**Solutions**:
1. Increase JVM heap size
2. Reduce checkpoint interval for more frequent cleanup
3. Run GC on a machine with more memory

```clojure
;; More frequent checkpoints
(datacamp/gc! conn
             :dry-run false
             :checkpoint-interval 50)  ; Checkpoint every 50 commits
```

#### GC Repeatedly Interrupted

**Symptoms**: GC never completes due to interruptions

**Solutions**:
1. Extend maintenance window
2. Run during quieter periods
3. Use checkpoint resume feature

```clojure
;; Will automatically resume from last checkpoint
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false)
```

#### Checkpoint Corruption

**Symptoms**: Cannot resume from checkpoint

**Solutions**:
1. Force new GC run
2. Clear checkpoint manually

```clojure
;; Force fresh start
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false :force-new true)

;; Or manually clear checkpoint
(require '[konserve.core :as k])
(k/dissoc store :datacamp)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Regular Maintenance

Schedule regular GC to prevent accumulation:

```clojure
(defn weekly-gc [conn]
  (datacamp/gc! conn
               :dry-run false
               :retention-days 30))
```

### 2. Monitoring Integration

Always monitor GC operations:

```clojure
(defn monitored-gc [conn]
  (future
    (let [result (datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false)]
      (metrics/record "gc.completed" result))))
```

### 3. Gradual Retention Reduction

For databases with significant bloat, gradually reduce retention:

```clojure
;; Week 1: Remove very old data
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false :retention-days 365)

;; Week 2: Reduce further
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false :retention-days 180)

;; Week 3: Target retention
(datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false :retention-days 30)
```

### 4. Backup Before GC

Always backup before running GC on production:

```clojure
(defn safe-gc [conn backup-config]
  ;; Create backup first
  (datacamp/backup-to-directory conn backup-config)

  ;; Then run GC
  (datacamp/gc! conn :dry-run false))
```

## Implementation Details

### Resumable Marking Algorithm

The marking phase uses a checkpoint-based approach:

1. **Branch Processing**: Each branch is processed independently
2. **Checkpoint Triggers**:
   - Every 100 commits processed
   - Every 30 seconds elapsed
   - After each branch completion
3. **State Persistence**: Checkpoint includes:
   - Current position in commit graph
   - Set of visited commits
   - Set of reachable items
   - Processing statistics

### Batch Deletion Strategy

The sweep phase optimizes deletion through batching:

1. **Pre-filtering**: All keys to delete are identified upfront
2. **Batch Formation**: Keys grouped into optimal batch sizes
3. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple batches processed concurrently
4. **Progress Reporting**: Regular updates on deletion progress

### Running Development Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bb test:gc

# Run with specific test
lein test :only datacamp.gc-test/specific-test-name

# Run with coverage
bb coverage
```

### Code Style

Follow existing patterns:
- Use `go-try` for async error handling
- Prefix batch operations with `batch-`
- Store datacamp data under `:datacamp` namespace
- Default to safe operations (dry-run)

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
1. Incremental GC without full marking
2. Parallel branch processing in mark phase
3. Native batch operations in Konserve
4. Automatic GC scheduling
5. GC progress visualization
